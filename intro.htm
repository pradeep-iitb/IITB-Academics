    <h1 >MECHANICAL INTRODUCTORY COURSE</h1>
 <p>Mechanical engineering derived from greek word mekhanikos . Grading - written quiz 30% In class Quiz 10 % Mid sem 20% end sem 40 % . Specialised stream - Design , Thermal fluids and Manufacturing . B.P of H<sub>2</sub> is 20K. Computational simulations includes Computational Fluid Dynamics , Finite Volume Method , Dynamic Space Analysis etc.</p>
 <p>In power plant , the energy used in compressing the steam obtained after rotating turbine is more then condensing and revaporising because compressing a liquid requires less pv work due to its less volume than a steam at higher volume. Combusition of H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> is is done while taking care of explotion limit.
