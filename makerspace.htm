<h4>Devices and Circuits</h4>
<p>Barrier potential for Si and Ge are o.6-0.7 and 0.2 to 0.25 V. In LEDs the e hole combination causes light emition which is continuous not depend on nos of e and hole in diode but transferred by battery. </p>
<p>In diode terminal characteristics i = I<sub>s</sub> [exp(v/V<sub>T</sub>)-1] here V<sub>T</sub> = qv/nKT here n is ideality factor and between 1 to 2 , 1 for Ge and 2 for Si . I<sub>s</sub> for Ge is in order uA and for Si in order nA . Circuit ground is represented by a triangle at wire end while earthing is different represented by parallel lines L to wire in triangle form . </p>
